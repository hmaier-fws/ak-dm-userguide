Alaska Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to improving the management of its data resources and is included in the regional strategic intent.  As a result, a comprehensive, long-term plan to develop and implement a Regional Data Management System (RDMS) began in the spring of 2020, with the expectation that the RDMS will be operational and in use in 3 to 5 years. \nProperly managed data are documented, secure, discoverable, and accessible and timely. Documentation (i.e., metadata or data about data) provides sufficient and relevant information so that users can understand, interpret, and use all of the data and resulting products without additional guidance. Security procedures prevent loss and ensure data integrity. Discoverable data is readily found (e.g., using a data catalog), whereas accessible data is readily obtained (e.g., downloaded from a website). Using these qualities together ensures the effectiveness and efficiency of the data resources both within the Service and beyond. \nThis user guide describes the data management activities necessary to build a preservation folder for a project. Data resources within the folder are the subject of metadata records and these resources, supported by their metadata records, are the authoritative versions intended for long-term storage, all subsequent workflow, analysis, products, and sharing to outside partners.  \nThis Interim Data Management User Guide is primarily for biologists and their supervisors in Fisheries and Ecological Services (FES), Migratory Bird Management (MBM), National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS), and the Office of Subsistence Management (OSM). This guide is a living document (working draft) and revisions will reflect the ongoing development of the available systems in addition to feedback obtained from users. The procedures and processes outlined here attempt to employ best practices under the current restrictions imposed by resource and policy limitations.  The team anticipates streamlining the current activities necessary in the interim for the final RDMS.\nThe first section of the document, Introduction, includes Why Data Management, The Big Picture: Integrating Data Management with Project Management, places data management activities into the larger context of the FWS mission, project management and provides guidance on determining which products should undergo data management. \nThe second section describes the Four Fundamental Activities of Data Management: Establish Roles and Responsibilities, Quality Management, Security and Preservation, and Documentation. A description of each activity and implementation guidance is given.\nThe remaining sections provide detailed guidance and best practices for each stages of the Data Management Lifecycle follow:  PLAN, ACQUIRE, MAINTAIN, SHARE.  A glossary is provided at the end to define data management-related terms used in this document. The Alaska Region Metadata Guide supplements this document by providing specific guidance for using mdEditor to write metadata. The mdEditor is a web-based application used to create archive-quality metadata for projects and products.\nlast update August 2022\n"},"background/why-data-managment.html":{"url":"background/why-data-managment.html","title":"Why Data Managment?","summary":"Introduction to the goals and benefits of data management","keywords":"","body":"Why Data Managment?\n​​​​​​​\"If a biologist counts a bird, and no one knows, does it really count?\"\nTo make data count, data must go beyond its immediate need. Staff must take additional steps to preserve data in a useful form and make it accessible and discoverable far into the future.  This is data management. \nData management = the practice and process of making data into a valuable asset. It includes various workflows and tools to collect, prepare, cleanse, access, integrate, and store data. \nData management consists of the practices, architectural techniques, and tools for achieving consistent access to and delivery of data across the spectrum of data subject areas and data structure types within the Service enterprise, to meet the data consumption requirements of all applications and business processes.\nObjectives of data management include: \n\nMake data, documents, and software freely and openly available for conservation use or research, online when possible, with visual and geographical representation as appropriate. \nPublish complete, high quality metadata for each dataset in a standardized format. \nInclude valuable existing and legacy data into the curation process whenever appropriate. \nDeliver high-integrity data in open and documented formats, in standard vocabularies for optimal usability and compatibility. \nSecurely archive data into the future. \nAggregate searchable metadata linked to online and offline sources. \nProvide for coordinated development, discovery, and use of systems for achieving the above. \n\n “Doing what we’ve always done is another sign of insanity in a changing environment.” — Craig Fugate, former FEMA administrator.  \nWhat can improving your data management skills do for you?  \nIncrease your productivity!  \nYou are already managing your data in some form.  Improving your skills can increase your productivity and can also improve your project management. \nImprove decision making for the Service! \nThe data we acquire, maintain, and analyze are important assets that advance the Service’s mission. Making decisions based on defensible, high-quality data improves our conservation outcomes, as well as the Service’s scientific credibility.  Data exchange among the scientific, resource management, and conservation communities is essential to achieving our shared conservation goals.\nSave time and resources! \nProperly managing data reduces time and resources on duplication.  Sharing data increases efficiency and enables collaboration across the Service.\nService policy supports data management!  \nData management in the Service have long been led by grassroots efforts from staff who recognize the benefits of improving our data management system (much of this came from the Alaska Region!). Recent policies have led to the creation of the Service's National Data Initiative, which requires that data is documented, shared, and archived accordingly AND has devoted resources to support training and tools to help you more effectively manage your data.  The OPEN data Act now requires it!\nLeave your mark in Service history!\nMuch of your work is connected to the data that you collect and analyze.  Documenting and archiving this data and its collection methods allows others to re-use and apply your data to future studies.  Your data citations are trackable too, with the use of persistent identifiers.\nWhat can you do for data management?  \nYou're already on your way to helping improve the Service's data management by using this guide.  It is designed to be the primary data management resource for you and to include something about everything from the data management lifecycle, tools and even policies.  If you want even more, join the national and regional communities to stay in the ‘know’.  \nSee the FWS Data Management SharePoint Page for more.\nLast Update August 2022\n"},"background/the-big-picture-integrating-data-management-with-project-management.html":{"url":"background/the-big-picture-integrating-data-management-with-project-management.html","title":"The Big Picture: Integrating Data Management with Project Management","keywords":"","body":"The Big Picture: Integrating Data Management with Project Management\nProject management and data management are different.

Projects are discrete efforts on a particular topic with defined objectives or goals. At this time, programs determine which projects (completed, ongoing, or proposed) should undergo data management. For example, use in management decisions and partner needs may be criteria managers could adopt to prioritize projects for data management. \nProducts (aka Data Resources) are recorded information generated by experiments, models, simulations, observations, analysis, and other activities that create or synthesize data resources. In a new project, anticipated products are identified during the planning stage when the design of sampling and analysis take place in consultation with the program’s biometrician. Determining which products to document is at the discretion of the principal investigator, their supervisor, and any relevant program or branch policies but guided by the principle of reuse.\n"},"four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/":{"url":"four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/","title":"Four Fundamental Activities of Data Management","keywords":"","body":"Four Fundamental Activities of Data Management\nThere are four fundamental activities of data management;\n\nEstablishing Roles and Responsibilities\nQuality Management \nSecurity and Preservation\nDocumentation\n\n\\\n"},"four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/quality-management.html":{"url":"four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/quality-management.html","title":"Quality Management","keywords":"","body":"Quality Management\nData quality management is composed of quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC). Quality assurance begins before data are collected and are procedures used to prevent errors from entering the data (e.g., using a mobile app for data collection that limits possible values that can be entered (pick-lists)). Quality control is the discovery and correction of errors in the data and generally occurs during or after data collection (e.g., detection of outliers, typographical error, a character datum where a numeric value is expected, using an incorrect species code, and etc.). Quality control should occur as soon as possible after collecting the data and before submitting data to the archive record or sharing. QA and QC procedures should be identified during the project planning phase in consultation with the program’s biometrician and/or data manager. Record quality management practices (QA and QC) in the mdEditor for all documented products. \nBest Practices in Quality Assurance\n\nUse documented protocols and standard methods\nUse high-quality instrumentation and regularly check accuracy\nProvide consistent training\nDevelop standardized data collection forms (data sheet templates or computer input with data validation formats)\n\nBest Practices in Quality Control\n\nInspect data values using summary functions (tabling unique values, calculating means and variances, etc.) or by applying complex analysis algorithms.\nIn Excel files, use sort and filter functions to look for data anomalies or outliers. \nVisually inspect data using scatterplots, regressions, and histograms.\n\n"},"four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/documentation.html":{"url":"four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/documentation.html","title":"Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Documentation\nUse the mdEditor to write metadata or data about the data. mdEditor is a web-based application developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIwg) that allows data-generators to write archival-quality metadata without specialized technical knowledge.

Working folders often exist on an individual’s computer hard drive and are used to collect, organize, and analyze products during the course of the project. In contrast, we use archive folders to store products that need to be retained over time. The products in the archive folders are the subject of metadata records to ensure that they are discoverable. \nConsistent archive folder organization across projects and programs allows the file creator, collaborators, supervisors, and our future colleagues to find relevant documents associated with a project quickly and understand how documents relate to one another. A tree structure describing the recommended file structure is in Appendix B. \nWhen needing to initiate a new project archive folder, contact your Data Stewardship Team (DST) member. They will set up the folder structure in the Regional Data Repository and give you the address to access the incoming folder (see Security and Preservation section). Folder names use a short acronym for your program, followed by a three-digit number, followed by the short title of the project (e.g., FESFRP_001_BarrowEider where FES FRP stands for FES Fairbanks Recovery Program).

The RDR is intended to be the regionally accessible, secure, authoritative storage location for project documents, records, data and metadata and as a single source for serving data and metadata to publicly accessible catalogs and other repositories.\nThe regional repository is for the storage of completed resources (this does not mean they can never be replaced or updated); it is not intended for active working files. The process of depositing files in the RDR was designed to implement a data management quality control process where: 1) a digital resource passes from the \"data producer\" to 2) the \"data steward\" (who reviews metadata quality) then on to 3) the \"data custodian\" (who moves the resource to an appropriate storage location). The program repositories are managed by the respective program data managers (i.e. Custodians).\\\nThis process helps to ensure that all assets in the repository have metadata that meet a minimum regional metadata standard and the project directory does not become a disorganized collection files that is often present in shared file systems.\nYou can reach the Repository by typing  \\\\ifw7ro-file.fws.doi.net\\datamgt into the address bar in File Explorer on any computer that is on, or has access to, the internal network.  Telework computers will need to use a VPN service like Pulse Secure to access the location.\nTo insure that files placed in the Repository are protected from loss or corruption, access to files within the Repository are controlled through permissions. You, and everyone on the network, may read and copy anything in the Repository, but write and modify permissions are limited. \nObtaining your project archive folder in the RDR\nTo obtain an archive folder for your project, complete a Data Management Plan (DMP) and submit it to your data manager.  The DMP is a working communication document between the project team and your data manager. \nAfter submission of a DMP, you will be provided with the address to your project archive folder in the RDR.

Restrictions to public access requires a legal justification such as a FOIA exemption.\nData must also be available internally.

It might be a population survey or perhaps an experiment to test the effects of changing a parameter. Planning for how the data will be obtained, what it will look like, and where the data will be stored begins early in the project lifecycle and should consider data needs. It does not take much time and can pay dividends in the long run. The final product – discoverable, accessible, documented, and secure data – is a result of effective data planning. \nWhat is a data management plan? \nThe data management plan (DMP) is a living document that serves as an easy-to-follow roadmap that covers collection, organization, use, storage, contextualization, preservation, and sharing of research data, as well as identifying responsibilities and required resources. It is the primary communication tool between the project staff and the data manager or data custodian. The goal of a DMP is to consider and document the proposed process of data handling over the course of the data management lifecycle. \nWhen do I need a DMP?\nThe data management policy (274 FW 1) specifies that all data \"created, acquired, or distributed, by or for the Service, in any medium or form\" after October 1, 2020 must fall under a data management plan. This encompasses financial, personnel, property, safety management, award, other administrative records, and scientific/research data, including data collected through MOU, cooperative agreements, or contracts. This requirement does not extend to data generated through Service grants or certain financial assistance awards when we do not otherwise have reason or authority to obtain data produced through these awards. \nPlanning requirements\nPer the Service’s data management policy, employees must ensure that data fall under a data management plan. Section 1.9A lists the following minimum elements that must be addressed in a DMP:\n\nThe type(s) of data to be collected (See Data Types)\nThe Data Trustee, Steward, Custodian, and Producer (See Establish Roles and Responsibilities)\nThe Board-approved repository where the data will be stored (See Archive)\nAny special access or use restrictions that might apply (See Access & Share)\nResources needed to maintain, store, and access the data throughout its lifecycle (See Maintain?)\nMetadata standards that will be used to describe the data (See Initiate Metadata)\nRecords schedule and disposition (See Records Management)\nInstructions on how to access the data (See Access & Share)\nQuality assurance and quality control processes that will be applied to the data (See QA/QC)\nThe frequency with which the data and metadata will be reviewed and updated (See Maintain)\n\nThere are a few DMP templates available to help Alaska Region staff create plans that meet all Service requirements.\nPlanning metadata\nThe planning phase is the ideal time to initiate metadata for your project and proposed data products. Metadata - or data about data - is crucial for making sure your data is documented, findable, and reusable. \nMetadata is officially defined as \"structural or descriptive information about data such as content, format, source, rights, accuracy, provenance, frequency, periodicity, granularity, contact information, publisher or responsible party, method of collection, and other descriptions\" (44 U.S.C 3502). It provides critical information, such as data content and quality, points of contact, where the data are stored, and use limitations and restrictions among other things. Posting metadata to metadata catalogs (e.g., data.gov) allows other users to search for datasets. \nThe first step to initiating metadata for projects and products is to choose an applicable metadata standard. The metadata standard you choose will depend on what type of data you are describing and what data repository you will be using. For example, geospatial data must be described with Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata (i.e. FGDC CSDGM, ISO 191xx series). Regardless of the standard used, the data management policy requires that metadata be: (a) created in a machine-readable and open format, (b) adequately described, (c) updated throughout the lifecycle of the data, and (d) preserved alongside the data. \nThe Alaska Region has developed a metadata standard checklist that staff can refer to in order to meet minimum content requirements.\nFor non-geospatial metadata, the Alaska Region data management staff recommend using the mdJSON standard, which can be created using mdEditor. Guidance on using mdEditor can be found in the Alaska Region Metadata Guide.\nUpdated July 2022\n"},"planning/project-and-data-management-integration.html":{"url":"planning/project-and-data-management-integration.html","title":"Project & Data Management Integration","summary":"Framework for integration of project management with data management","keywords":"","body":"Project & Data Management Integration\nProject management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to oversee a project to completion in the desired time and to a specified quality.

In the future, more specific guidance and training will be available for each data type.\nGuidance is also given on converting data formats produced from commonly used programs (e.g., MS Office or ESRI ArcGIS) into preferred open formats.

Multiple spreadsheets within the same file can contain data and derivatives of the data (tables, summaries, pivot tables, formulas, figures). Below are some best practices when dealing with this type of data. \n\nOne sheet in the file should contain a clean version of the data. Nothing else should be on this sheet. This is sometimes also referred to as tidy data. In tidy data:\nThe first row contains variable names and each column represents one variable. Variable names should use only letters, numbers, dashes, “-“, and underscores, “_”. Do not use spaces or any other characters. The variable name should include the unit where this is relevant (e.g., length_cm and weight_g).\nEach row after the first row should represent one observation.\nAvoid formatting information in this sheet (e.g., comma in the thousands place, font settings, border lines, colors, etc). If the formatting is there to convey some information; instead, add a new variable to record that information. For example, instead of highlighting a cell to indicate a possible error, add another column and assign an error code to the observation (e.g. 1=sensor failure, 2=lost data sheet).\nFor the purposes of tidy data, blank cells indicate that the data point is missing; some use -9999 to indicate missing data. “0” in a cell means that the data point was collected and it was “0”. The treatment of missing data should always be recorded in the data dictionary (see below).\nThe tidy data sheet, in addition to being part of the workbook, should also be saved in an open format (e.g. Text  or CSV or TSV) using the same name as the Excel file (e.g., fish_data.xlsx and fish_data.csv) in the same archive folder as the Excel file.\n\n\nOne sheet in the file should provide a brief description of each variable in the tidy data. Each row of this sheet represents one variable. This is termed the data dictionary and will be part of the metadata record for the tidy data. An example and a template for the data dictionary is available here. \nOther sheets in the file can contain summaries of the data (pivot tables), graphical representations of the data (figures), or derived quantities from the data (formulae, macros, etc). Avoid including metadata on these sheets.\nOne sheet in the file should provide a brief description of each sheet in the file (what does it contain, any relevant information about its use) like a table of contents. Each row of this sheet represents one sheet of the file. First column is the sheet name, the second column is the sheet description.\nSave the original workbook in the most recent format supported by the application.

When possible, the database should be documented within the database application (e.g. from within MS Access, add title and abstract to database properties and add description for all tables and fields)\nEnforce constraints on variables to promote Quality Assurance (see Quality Management section). For example, in a variable named “Gender,” inputs could be constrained to the values of “Female,” “Male,” and “Unknown;\"  in a variable named “Length_mm,” only integers between 10 and 1000 may be allowable values.\nIf possible, consider converting MSAccess databases to SQLite, an open format that will preserve the database functionality. Utilities are available to assist with this, but may require additional technical assistance. Contact your DST member if you are interested in this conversion.\nIf conversion is not possible, MSAccess tables and their data dictionaries should be exported to a preferred open format (e.g. Text or CSV) and the database structure (relationships diagram in MSAccess) should be saved to a preferred open format (e.g. JPEG or PNG) throughout the duration of the project and at the completion of the project.

Data quality management is the prevention and correction of data defects or issues within a dataset that reduce our ability to apply data towards our science-based conservation efforts. There are two distinct components of data quality management that are often lumped together: quality assurance and quality control. \n\nQuality Assurance (QA) – Implementing processes that prevent data defects from occurring. For example, writing a detailed protocol for a long-term survey so the methodology is maintained as new staff come on board. Quality assurance begins before the data are collected and includes processes and procedures used to prevent errors while collecting or entering the data.\nQuality Control (QC) – Detecting and repairing defects once you have the data. For example, noticing a negative value in a count field may indicate a data-entry error, which might be fixed by reviewing a field data sheet.

One DMP option is the Alaska Region machine-readable DMP template that can be used to automatically initiate metadata records.\nEven if you have started writing metadata, you should complete a DMP, if you have not done so. \nIf your project is ongoing (ie. annual survey), and you have already completed a DMP, please just take a moment to confirm that nothing has changed.  \n#2: Complete your PROJECT Metadata Record \nIf you used the machine-readable DMP template, you will have a Project metadata record populated from the fields in your DMP ready for updating in mdEditor where records can be updated.  Needed updates will likely include adding GCMD keywords, taxonomy, and spatial extent, if not provided in the DMP.  See the project metadata creation section of this guidance to ensure that your project metadata meets the regional requirements. \nIf your are starting your metadata from scratch, this training video can help you get started.  Also, see the project metadata creation section in this guide.\n#3: Collect and Clean your Data \nAfter acquiring your data, prepare your data for re-use.  This means that the data tables are tidy, open source, and have passed quality control checks.  Tidy data means that each column is a type of data, each row is a single data entry, and values are present throughout the table.  For more tips on tidy data, check out this training video. Also see the Quality Management and Acquire section of this guidance.\nDon't forget to prepare a data dictionary that defines your column names, measurement units, and any codes found in the dataset.  This is necessary for others to be able to understand the data.\n#4: Complete your data PRODUCT metadata \nOnce your data is cleaned, complete your data product metadata.  If you included the dataset in your DMP, you have a data Product metadata record ready to be completed.  See the product metadata creation section of this guide.  Both raw data and final, clean data should be documented with metadata.\nWhen your metadata is complete, ask your data manager if a persistent identifiers is appropriate for you project or products.  A Digital Object Identifier is one persistent identifier option.  This is essentially a Social Security number for your dataset.  It creates a permanent citation link for your data so that it can be referenced in reports, publications, or larger data analysis, in addition to making your data more discoverable.\n#5: Store Data and Metadata \nYour data and completed metadata is required to be made publicly available.  The Alaska Regional Data Repository is a regional home for the preservation of Alaska authoritative data and completed metadata.  Use of the RDR enables data managers to access and share your metadata and data with public repositories as appropriate.\nCurrently, FWS does not have approved data repositories for Service-wide use.  \n\n#6: Share metadata and data publicly\nPolicy requires that the authoritative copy is maintained on a FWS system, but a COPY of metadata and data may be shared with internal and external catalogs and repositories as desired.

If you are working with a long-standing dataset, it is recommended to add unique identifiers before conducting any tidying procedures. This addition not only prevents errors, but allows you to cross-reference with previous versions of the dataset. \nBefore you begin, verify the current dataset does not contain duplicate records. This is particularly important if unique identifiers are being applied for the first time to a long-standing dataset. For example, In a bird banding dataset, you may concatenate the species, band number and date variables into a new column and check for uniqueness using the Conditional Formatting command in Excel.\nOnce record uniqueness is established, add a column of unique identifiers. This may be done by concatenating values from key variables in the dataset or creating universally unique identifiers. Key variables are existing variables in the dataset that, separately and/or in combination, uniquely identify the record. Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) are a formula-generated 128-bit integer number used to identify resources. 128-bits is big enough and the generation algorithm is unique enough that if every human on Earth generated 600,000,000 UUIDs there would only be a 50% probability of a duplicate.\nIdentifier Best Practices\n\nName the identifier column something unique and \"identifying\". A few options are \"identifierID\", \"recordID\", or \"occurenceID\".\nUtilize numeric identifiers to increase efficiency of sorting and filtering records. Do not use spaces, special characters or accents in the identifiers, since they may be modified when the dataset is converted in different formats.\nLimit the number of characters used in identifiers or utilize separators to avoid truncation. Specifically, Microsoft Excel has a character limit of 15 for numeric values and any digits past the fifteenth place is changed to zero. However, this can be avoided by inserting separators in the identifier (i.e. UUIDs use dashes). \nIf you create identifiers with key variables, ensure the variables uniquely identify each observation. Variables that have missing, zero, or null values are not suitable as key variables. Further, consider whether it is possible for an identifier comprised of concatenated key variables to be duplicated. Example: In a bird banding dataset, species, band number, and date may be suitable as key variables in combination IF the previously stated conditions are met.\n\nOptions for creating UUIDs\nOnline UUID Generator\nCreate a bulk number of UUIDs using one of many online UUID generators and paste the requisite number  in the designated identifier column of the dataset.\nExcel\nCreate a copy of the empty identifier column in the dataset. Paste the following into the first cell of the copied column: \n\\=LOWER(CONCATENATE(DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0,4294967295),8),\"-\",DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0,65535),4),\"-\",DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(16384,20479),4),\"-\",DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(32768,49151),4),\"-\",DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0,65535),4),DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0,4294967295),8)))\nDrag the cell with the formula to the bottom of the dataset. When each record has a UUID, highlight the column and copy /’paste special’ to the original identifier column and select ‘Values’ to make sure that only the values are pasted and not formulas. Delete the identifier column with formulas.\nR\nYou can generate UUIDs in R using various package. One option is the function UUIDgenerate() from the uuid package. The following code demonstrates how to add an identifier column with UUIDs to a example data frame. Paste and run the code in RStudio to see how it works.\nFWS employees can install R and RStudio on a DOI Windows computer from FWS Apps-to-Go.

Intermediate datasets created during the tidying process do not need to be archived in the RDR.\nDocuments\nDocuments generated by the project should be filed in this folder, and they can include:\n\nData management plans\nInvestigation plans or protocol documents guiding project procedures\nProposal documents prepared to solicit internal or external funding\nPublic relations materials like photographs, graphics, maps, etc.\nReports and white papers that are not peer-reviewed, but provide results or information from the project\nFinal manuscripts and peer-reviewed publications\nTalks, recordings, posters, or presentation slides related to the project\n\nIncoming\nThis folder allows the data steward(s)--who are granted write permission--to add project data, documents, and metadata that are ready to be archived in the RDR. Your data manager will then properly organize the files dropped into this folder. Alternatively, the data steward(s) can email project data to their data manager or technician for filing in the RDR.\nAll files should be saved in an open format and abide by recommended file naming conventions prior to being added to the \"incoming\" folder.\n\nMetadata\nThis folder holds mdEditor and mdJSON files of your project metadata, which can be created using mdEditor. Typically, this folder contains a single mdEditor file that encompasses all of your project's metadata and multiple mdJSON files for individual project and product metadata records.\nAll files in your project's RDR folder should be accompanied by metadata.\n\nChange Log\nAlso referred to as a README file, the changelog is a text file communicating updates made to the RDR project folder. It also includes details about who made those updates and when they were made.\nUpdated July 2022\n"},"sharing-1/untitled/obtaining-a-digital-object-identifier-doi.html":{"url":"sharing-1/untitled/obtaining-a-digital-object-identifier-doi.html","title":"Obtaining a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)","keywords":"","body":"Obtaining a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\nA digital object identifier (DOI; www.doi.org) is a unique identifier permanently associated with a data resource (csv file, report, published paper, etc.). For example, below is the DOI for this guide. \n\nThe FWS DOI Tool allows you to manage DOIs and associate metadata with them. When you 'click' on a DOI link or enter the link directly at www.doi.org, you are redirected to the website given in the resource's metadata. The main advantage of a DOI is that if the underlying web link changes, you just have to update the DOI metadata. \nDo not create a DOI for published journal articles or anything else that already has a DOI.  Use the existing DOI assigned by the publisher.\n\nWhen you create a DOI, you or someone in your organization is responsible for maintaining them. Whenever the metadata for the resource changes, you must update that information using the FWS DOI tool. \n\nTo reserve a DOI for a product, all you need is the title of the product and the FWS office or program responsible for managing the product. You should use the same title as is in your metadata record for the product. Before you begin, please note that you should not create fake or test DOIs.\nDo not create fake or test DOIs!\n\nTo reserve a DOI, follow these steps: \n\nGo to the FWS DOI Tool\nRead the text in the 'New User?' box. \nSign in using your Active Directory username and password \nClick the 'Create DOI' button\nEnter the title and select your program\nClick 'Reserve my DOI' \nSelect 'Add Manager'\nEnter the name of a secondary person that will manage this DOI in your absence. You should enter the Data Custodian for your program. You may also add others, if appropriate. The Active Directory search is slow and often fails, please be patient. After it fails, you can directly enter the person's FWS email. \n\nAdd the Data Custodian for your program as a secondary person who will manage the DOI.\n\nYou now have a DOI reserved for the product. You can save that information and return later or add more information to finish the record and publish the DOI. To finish the record, follow these steps:\n\nLogin, navigate to your record, and select the 'Required Information' tab on the left.\n Add the following information:\npublication year, \nauthor contacts (individual or organizational), \nURL of the product, and\nselect a resource type from the drop down list. \n\n\n(optional) Navigate to the 'Supplemental Information' tab and enter any additional information there. \nAt this point you can save the record for publishing later by selecting 'Save unpublished record' on the left or you can publish the record by selecting 'Publish Approved Record to DataCite.' If your record has been approved, select the latter.\nA confirmation box titled 'Publish DOI?' will appear. To confirm and publish the DOI, select 'YES, publish this DOI'.\n\nThe information is then sent to DataCite where the DOI is published. When someone enters the DOI link into a web browser, they are redirected to the URL you provided in the metadata.  Usually after a few minutes (it could be up 24 hours), you should be able to locate your data product by entering the DOI at www.doi.org. If it does not work after 24 hours or you have any other problems, contact the FWS DOI Tool Service Desk. \nCurrently there is no official Region-wide approval process for obtaining DOIs and publishing data products. You should seek the approval of the Data Steward, Project Manager (PI), and your Supervisor. \n\n"},"planning/data-management-plan/":{"url":"planning/data-management-plan/","title":"Data Management Plan Templates","keywords":"","body":"Data Management Plan Templates\nCompleting a DMP is a National Service Requirement.\n\nThe DMP is the primary communication tool between the project team and the data manager or data custodian.\nThe DMP is a partner document to your project documents (i.e., proposal, investigation plan, protocols, etc.). The Alaska region offers a machine-readable Microsoft Word DMP template for region-wide use. The most recent version can be found at the link below. The form must be completed in the desktop version of Microsoft Word.\n\\\nA DMP is required to be completed for any new or ongoing projects. Ongoing projects may just need to review and update an existing DMP. Completed DMPs are housed in the project folder in the Regional Data Repository. A DMP is a living document that can be updated as needed throughout the course of a project.\n\nBenefits of using the regional machine-readable DMP template:\n1) This template can be used to initiate your PROJECT and PRODUCT metadata records for import into mdEditor. A computer code (i.e., Python script) extracts information from a completed DMP and writes metadata field equivalents into an mdEditor file. This automation eliminates the redundancy of having to manually input the same information from the DMP into your metadata.\n2) A completed DMP is the mechanism to allocate a project space in the Regional Data Repository. There is no need to complete the RDR Project Folder Request form when using the regional DMP template.\n3) Lastly, this template is designed to meet the policy requirements of the Service National DMP template.\nRegional Template Guidance\nDMP Section 1: Project Details \nThe first section collects basic project information and includes:\n\nProgram Name: (Required) Choose your program name from the dropdown list. While hidden, the default region is the USFWS Alaska Region. Multiple programs can be added.\nCost Center: (Required) Choose your cost center from the dropdown list. Please let your data manager know if there are any discrepancies to this list. Multiple cost centers can be added.\nProject Title: (Required) Enter a descriptive, yet succinct title. Include species, time frame, geography, season, method or purpose, as appropriate.\nStart and End Dates: (Required) Enter a start date and end date from the calendar pick tools. Project start date is generally when the project is approved, funded, or when work actually began. End date is the date that a final product is completed (i.e. report) or funding ends and may be an estimated date. If the project is a long-term monitoring effort, check the ongoing box rather than selecting an end date.\nAbstract: (Required) Enter a description of the project into the text box. This can be copy and pasted from a proposal or investigation plan. Note: multiple paragraphs are not allowed, so limit the abstract to a single, succinct paragraph.\nKeywords: (Optional) Enter comma-separated keywords in the text box. Keywords may be location, species, survey method, or biological event of interest. For example: Eastern red knot, Maine, migration, stopover sites\nUnique Project Identifier or Tracking Number: (Optional) Enter the project identifier(s) into the text box, if applicable. This can be a funding agreement number, contract number, or any other identifier that can link your data products to the project effort. If the project is refuge initiative, enter the PRIMR survey ID. Internal projects may not have any project tracking identifiers.\nSpatial Extent: (Required) Enter a brief text description and/or the URL location of the project spatial extent, if available. The URL may reference a shapefile, geoJSON, KML, geopackage, geoTIFF or other. Spatial features should be provided in latitude and longitude coordinates (WGS84). Note: In order to include extent features in the metadata generated by the script, files must be in geoJSON format and on a shared server location, not a local computer. File paths must include the full server name instead of the mapped drive letter (i.e., \"\\\\ifw7ro-file.fws.doi.net\\datamgt\\extents\\ simplified_refuge\\KenaiNWR.geojson\" instead of \"D:\\extents\\ simplified_refuge\\KenaiNWR.geojson\"). Simplified refuge boundaries can be found in the RDR. Other simplified boundaries can be created and shared upon request.\n\nDMP Section 2: Project Personnel \nSection 2 collects the project staff information (Required, at least one) and includes:\n\nPrimary Contact: This is the person who can be contacted regarding the data management plan itself. Note: this is not the primary contact of the project (the data steward).\nData Steward: This person is responsible for ensuring that collected data is tidy, clean, complete, quality controlled and assured, and appropriately documented with metadata. This may be the field crew leader or the project manager and serves as the primary contact for the project. This person should be highly knowledgeable regarding the project and its data products. This person will be a 'point of contact' in the metadata.\nData Custodian: This is person responsible for the long-term management of authoritative copies of data and metadata. This may be your program or regional data manager (if using the RDR) or may also be the project manager. This person will be listed as the 'custodian' in the metadata.\nData Trustee: This is the person responsible for ensuring that your project team has the resources allocated to fulfill all aspects of the project and data lifecycle. This is also likely the person who approved or renewed your project, such as your program manager or field office supervisor. This person will be the 'owner' in the metadata.\n\nThe form provides additional space to add other project staff and/or collaborators. Use the plus (+) button (see blue arrow below) to add more contact entry rows. This allows you to give credit to those who may not have key data management role responsibilities, but who contributed time or resources toward your project. Their names will also appear in the metadata with their corresponding roles.\nThe Service Data Management Handbook provides additional guidance on these key roles and responsibilities.\n (1).png>)\nDMP Section 3: Metadata & Data Standards\nCheck the box to indicate that your project and data products will be documented with metadata that meets regional and programmatic (super easy!). Currently, the are not a national metadata standard.\nDon't worry—the metadata creation guidance section in this guide will ensure that your metadata meets these standards.\nAlternatively, if you would like to use another metadata standard, check the 'Other' box and select an option from the dropdown list.   Be aware that this regional guidance does not address other metadata standards.\nThis section ends with a reminder that data collection must follow Service-wide data standards. This guide provides a brief review of common Service-approved data standards and links to the full list.\nDMP Section 4: Data Sharing, Security, and Preservation\nShort-term storage, backup and security: The primary causes of data loss are human error and hardware corruption; therefore, it is critically important that short-term data storage is backed up and secure. Identify here where the short-term, primary working project and data files will be located. This is NOT the Regional Data Repository (RDR) and should NOT be your computer hard drive. This should be a shared digital storage location with a backup and recovery protocol in place. Good options include OneDrive, Teams file folders, or a network drive. If there are internet connectivity concerns, working files may be stored on your computer hard drive for ease of use or on an additional external hard drive as a back-up, but must also be maintained in an accessible Service location.  Files stored locally should have backups and version controls.\nWe highly recommend mirroring the RDR files top-level folder structure for your short-term storage since it will provide continuity across storage platforms. In this way, anyone can generally find items within other project, data, and metadata file folders.\n\nIndicate how frequently the primary, short-term storage location back-up is done during the project. Choose from a drop-down list of options or choose other and describe the back-up frequency in the input box. Be sure to implement this!\nIf there are any data access restrictions that should apply to the short-term file storage, please detail those restrictions at the bottom of this section.\nRegional Data Repository: The Regional Data Repository (RDR) was set up as an organized, long-term storage for authoritative preservation of project data and products for the Alaska region. Folders and files in the RDR have permissions set so that only specified individuals have write access to the directories and can modify files. All other Service individuals will have read-only access.\nFrom the RDR, copies of data and metadata may be shared, as appropriate, to other federal or external repositories and catalogs. Enter the URL location of the Regional Data Repository for your project if one already exists. If one does not currently exist, enter an abbreviated project title that you would like to use for your RDR folder. Check the box to indicate if you will be using the RDR as the authoritative long-term storage location for your project data assets. Some programs may require use of the RDR (as your data manager).\nBecause the Service does NOT currently have officially approved repositories, the RDR serves as an authoritative staging and secure preservation location for regional project, data assets, products and associated metadata that are readily available for distribution to other catalogs and repositories, as appropriate.\n\nPublic Data Sharing Repositories: A copy of the data and metadata may be shared with other federal or external catalogs or repositories. List the public repositories you intend to use here. Use the plus (+) to add additional rows to the table.\nNote that Refuges are required to store data assets in ServCat.\n (1).png>)\nDMP Section 5: Records Schedule and Disposition\nPermanent electronic records must be transferred to the National Archive according to records schedules. The most relevant records disposition schedules most commonly applicable to biological data collection are presented as dropdown options. Choose the records schedule that best classifies your data type, then visit thee Combined USFWS Disposition Manual (2006) weblink to select your the record type and find your disposition schedule. Use the plus (+) button to add rows, if more than one record type applies. If a record type applies that is not present in the shortlist, you can also manually enter a value in the record type field.\nFeel free to contact the Alaska Regional Records Expert is Kyle Cahill (kyle_cahill@fws.gov or (907)786-3351) for assistance.\n\nData Products\nIn some, but not all cases, projects have anticipated data products, whether a table, geographic dataset, or a series of photographs.  Cataloging these anticipated data products during the planning phase can help identify resource need for the project.  Additionally, use of the regional machine-readable DMP template will initiate metadata records for your data products, if needed, and create the project-product associations within the metadata records.   \nFor digital data products, the following are the attribute fields:\nComplete a Digital Data Product (required) and Physical Sample (optional) table for each data product that you expect to produce or use during your project. Data products may include (but are not limited to) data tables, shapefiles, computer code, or reports. To add a table, click on the plus (+) button in in the lower right corner of the table.\n\nProduct Name:  Enter the name or title of the data product\nLocation url:  Enter the location of the data resource.

There are plenty of options, but 'other' is not one of them.\nData Restrictions:  Choose from the dropdown list where or not the data is restricted.  Note that restricted data still requires metadata to be discoverable.  In the majority of cases, data is open-access or unrestricted.  If data restrictions apply, provide a justification.  See data restrictions for more information.\nSupplemental Materials:  List data products that are needed to understand this data product.  This may include relational diagram, photo and video naming conventions, or pre-existing datasets from which this product was derived.\nSpatial Extent:  Indicate if the spatial extent is the same as the project extent or if not, indicate the location of a spatial dataset for the data product.\n\nRestricted data still requires metadata to be written and be publicly searchable.  See constraints section in product metadata for more information. \n\nIf using the regional machine-readable Alaska region DMP template, a metadata record will be created for each expected product and each record will automatically be associated with the project metadata record.\n\n (1).png>)\nDigital Data Table\nA data table should be completed for each digital data type (e.g., table, database, model, geospatial layer, or photo/video collection. The following are the DMP fields for digital data.\n\nCollection Name: \nDescription:  Enter a description of the physical samples in the text box.  Include number of samples and how they were used.\nLabeling Standards:  Describe how the samples were labeled and the meaning of any codes or abbreviations used.  \nQuality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures: Describe in the text box the procedures and methods used to collect and compile the the data from the sample to ensure quality data.\nStorage Location and Conditions: Identify the location of the physical samples and the conditions in which the samples are stored in the text box.\nChain of Custody:  Describe the chain of custody, controls, or transfer procedure of the physical samples in the text box.\nFate After Analysis:  Describe the long-term storage or disposition plan for the physical samples in the text box. \nData Products Derived:   Provide the name of the data product that directly resulted from the collection of these physical samples. __ \nProduct Title: (Required) Enter  naa descriptive name or title of the data product\nLocation url: (Optional) Enter the location of the data resource.
